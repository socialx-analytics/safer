The goal of safer is to help run long analytical processes safely.
Imagine we are running an analysis process that takes several hours and
then a crash occurs, or other conditions that require us to run the
entire analysis process from the start. Donâ€™t worry, this is safer.

## Installation

You can install the development version of safer from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
